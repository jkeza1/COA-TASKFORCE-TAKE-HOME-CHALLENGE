# COA-TASKFORCE-TAKE-HOME-CHALLENGE

## Overview

Welcome to the COA Taskforce Take-Home Challenge! This repository contains a collection of tasks designed to test your skills in various programming concepts and problem-solving abilities. In this challenge, you'll encounter tasks ranging from building a Photo Gallery application to implementing algorithms for array manipulation and string transformation.

## Photo Gallery Application

### Overview

The Photo Gallery application allows users to browse through a collection of photos in an interactive and visually appealing way.

### Features

- **Thumbnail Images:** Display a grid of thumbnail images for users to browse.
- **Dynamic Overlays:** Overlay information or effects on images for interactivity.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure compatibility and optimal viewing across different devices.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkeza1/COA-TASKFORCE-TAKE-HOME-CHALLENGE.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd photo gallery
```
# Open the HTML File:

Open index.html in your preferred web browser to view the photo gallery.

**Interactivity:**
Explore any interactive overlays or effects added to the photos.
Customization

**Adding Photos:**
Add your photos to the images directory.
Update the HTML dynamically to include new thumbnail images.

**Styling:**
Customize the appearance of the gallery by modifying the CSS file (styles/style.css).

## Challenges

 ## Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
Overview
In this challenge, you'll implement the hasSubarrayWithTargetSum function, a powerful tool to determine whether a contiguous subarray within an array sums up to a specified target value.

# Function Description
The hasSubarrayWithTargetSum function takes two parameters:

**arr:** An array of integers.

**target:** The target sum value.

It returns true if there exists a subarray whose elements sum up to the target value. 

Otherwise, it returns false.

# Example Usage:
```bash
const arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const target = 17;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithTargetSum(arr, target)); // Output: true
```
## Challenge 2: String Transformation
Overview
In this challenge, you'll implement the transformString function, a versatile tool for transforming strings based on specific rules.

# Function Description
The transformString function takes a string (input) as its parameter and applies transformation rules based on the length of the input string.

# Example Usage
```bash
console.log(transformString("Hamburger")); // Output: "regrubmaH"
console.log(transformString("Pizza")); // Output: "80 105 122 122 97"
console.log(transformString("Chocolate Chip Cookie")); // Output: "eikooCpihCetalocohC"
```
