  ## challenge1-Array Manipulation

## Overview

Welcome to the Subarray with Target Sum README! This document provides an in-depth explanation of the `hasSubarrayWithTargetSum` function, a powerful tool to determine whether a contiguous subarray within an array sums up to a specified target value.

## Function Description

The `hasSubarrayWithTargetSum` function takes two parameters:
- `arr`: An array of integers.
- `target`: The target sum value.

It returns `true` if there exists a subarray whose elements sum up to the target value. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Algorithm: Sliding Window Technique

The function employs the efficient sliding window technique to search for the subarray. Here's how it works:
1. Initialize two pointers: `start` and `end`.
2. Iterate through the array with the `end` pointer, adding elements to the current sum.
3. While the current sum exceeds the target value, shrink the window from the left by incrementing the `start` pointer and subtracting the element at the `start` index from the current sum.
4. Check if the current sum equals the target value. If so, return `true`.
5. If the loop completes without finding a matching subarray, return `false`.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const target = 17;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithTargetSum(arr, target)); // Output: true
## Example Usage

To illustrate the usage of the `hasSubarrayWithTargetSum` function, consider the following example:

```javascript
const arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const target = 17;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithTargetSum(arr, target)); // Output: true
```
